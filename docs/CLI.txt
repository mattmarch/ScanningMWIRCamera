# How to use the command line interface for using the MWIR Scanning Camera Program.

There are 2 usage modes:

Usage (1d):
CameraCLI 1d axis other_axis_pos start range step [--n_sample=value options]

    axis - axis to scan with camera
        options:
            x
            y
    other_axis_pos - position of the other axis in mm
    start - start position in mm
    range - range of scan in mm
    step - step size in mm
    n_sample - determines samples per pixel (default = 20)
    options:
        sample_func - determines function to apply to sample (default rms)
            -rms2 (rms squared)
            -max
            -average
        output - determines the action to display the output (defaults to displaying plot)
            -save_image (saves an image of the plot)
            -save_csv (saves data as .csv)
        cmap - determines colour mapping of output (default inferno)
            -heat1
            -heat2
            -grey1
            -grey2
        interpolation - determines interpolation method (default nearest neighbour interpolation)
            -linear (linear interpolation)
            -cubic (cubic interpolation)
            -sinc (sinc based interpolation)

Example:
    CameraCLI 1d x 20 10 30 0.1 --n_sample=40 -save_image -linear
    Performs a 1d scan of x axis starting at 10mm, range of 30mm, with y = 20mm and step size 0.1mm. 40 samples per pixel, output set to save image with linear interpolation.


Usage (2d):
CameraCLI 2d start_x start_y range_x range_y step_x [step_y] [--n_sample=value options]

    start_x - x start position in mm
    start_y - y start position in mm
    range_x - x range of scan in mm
    range_y - y range of scan in mm
    step_x - x step size in mm
    step_y - y step size in mm (if not provided defaults to step_x
    n_sample and options same as for 1d usage

Example:
    CameraCLI 2d 20 15 25 25 0.1 -max -heat1
    Performs a 2d scan starting at (20mm, 15mm), covering a 25mm x 25mm square with 0.1mm step sizes in both directions. The maximum sampled value is picked and the colour mapping of output uses 'heat1'.
