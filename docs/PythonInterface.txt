# Interfacing with the Camera class from Python

The camera class can be easily used from within a Python program.

To import and initialise an instance of the class:

  from Camera import *
  # initialise
  c = Camera()

The sampling parameters can be set before a scan:

  sample_n = 20
  sample_func = 'rms'
  c.set_sampling_variables(sample_n, sample_func)

To perform a 2D scan:

  # variables in form (x, y)
  start = (20, 30)
  img_size = (15, 15)
  pixel_size = (0.1, 0.1)
  scan = c.scan_image(start, img_size, pixel_size)
  # or to supress output to console
  scan = c.scan_image(start, img_size, pixel_size, display_time=False)

For a 1D scan:

  # x axis = 0, y axis = 1
  axis = 0    # selects x axis
  # y position
  other_axis_pos = 30
  start = 10
  scan_range = 20
  step = 0.1
  scan = c.scan_row(axis, other_axis_pos, start, scan_range, step)

The output will be a ScanData instance with the following properties accessible:

  # setup for both 1D and 2D scans. Will be stored as floats for 1D, and tuples for 2D case.
  scan.step
  scan.start
  scan.scan_range
  # values obtained from scan, will be 1D array for 1D scan, 2D array for 2D scan
  scan.data
  # timestamp from end of scan
  scan.timestamp
  # 1D scan properties, will be set to None in case of 2D scan
  scan.scan_axis
  scan.off_axis_pos
